## What the hell is this???

My primary way of communicating with friends in class is just by typing in my terminal and them looking over my shoulder.
I kept having to spam <kbd>Ctrl +</kbd> to zoom in so they could see, so this just automatically zooms in, provides a repl-like environment, and then resets the zoom afterwards.

Is it useless? Yes! \
Do I care? No!

```
$ cargo install terminal-talk

$ ttalk
> Hey there, look it's zoomed in and my friend can read it!
```
